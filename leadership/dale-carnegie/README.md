**Tips from Dale Carnegie Institute**

So, I have been receiveing a trainig from [Dale Carnegie institue](http://co.dalecarnegie.com/) which I found very interesting and would like to share.

Try to follow one or two rules at a time for one or two weeks making in conciously, the you will find yourself doing it by default and feeling the progress and advantages of it.
